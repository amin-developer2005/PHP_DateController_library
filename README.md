An Object-Oriented PHP library for converting Gregorian dates to Jalali dates and vice versa. This library includes a DateController class that offers two main methods: one for converting Gregorian dates to Jalali dates, and another for converting Jalali dates to Gregorian dates. I've designed it to be easy to use into your PHP projects.
